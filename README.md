# Recommendations for Safest Aircrafts 

## Overview

  In this study, we aim to process, clean, understand, and produce statistically significant data in order to make evidence-based decisions in terms of operating the safest aircrafts.
  Starting from a large dataset, we will be able to determine a list of top 10 safest aircrafts from professional manufacturers worldwide.
  
## Business Understanding

Business owners that are looking to invest in commercial and private flight operations need to have a well-defined picture of the aircraft statistical spectrum in order to make purchases that will best fit their business model. Therefore, key questions related to the aircraft operations industry must be answered before the company proceeds with acquiring any flight apparatus. 

These questions include, but are not limited to:

How many accidents are associated with the aircraft makes?
How many fatal injuries are associated with each make?
How many individuals have survived in accidents associated with each make?
What are the percent chances of survival in case of an accident?
How is the number of engines on an aircraft related to overall aircraft safety?
How is flight protocol related to overall aircraft safety?
